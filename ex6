Configure a test environment to launch MITM and dictionary attacks and verify the 
	    captured data. 

## **Aim**

To configure a **controlled test environment** to **simulate Man-In-The-Middle (MITM)** and **dictionary attack scenarios** for educational purposes, and to **observe and verify captured data**, thereby understanding common security threats and their impact on **client–server communication and RPA systems**.

---

## **Objectives**

* To understand MITM and dictionary attack concepts
* To set up a **safe and isolated test environment**
* To observe how data can be intercepted or attacked
* To verify the type of data captured during attacks
* To study security implications for **RPA workflows**

---

### **Environment Components**

* Virtual Machine (Client)
* Virtual Machine (Server)
* Isolated Network (Host-only / NAT)
* Test application with dummy credentials
* Packet analysis tools (Wireshark)
* Authentication logs (server side)

---

## **Conceptual Overview**

### **1. Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) Attack (Simulation)**

A MITM attack occurs when an attacker secretly intercepts communication between a client and server.

**Observed Effects (Simulation):**

* Network packets can be captured
* Unencrypted data may be visible
* SSL/TLS protects sensitive payloads

---

### **2. Dictionary Attack (Simulation)**

A dictionary attack attempts authentication using a predefined list of common passwords.

**Observed Effects (Simulation):**

* Multiple failed login attempts
* Authentication logs show repeated failures
* Account lockout mechanisms get triggered

---

## **Procedure**

### **A. Test Environment Setup**

1. Create two virtual machines (Client and Server).
2. Configure both machines on the same isolated virtual network.
3. Deploy a test web or login application using dummy data.
4. Enable logging on the server.

---

### **B. MITM Simulation (Observation-Based)**

1. Initiate client–server communication using test credentials.
2. Capture traffic using a network analyzer.
3. Observe:

   * IP addresses
   * Protocols used (TCP/HTTPS)
   * Encryption presence
4. Verify whether sensitive data is readable or encrypted.

---

### **C. Dictionary Attack Simulation (Observation-Based)**

1. Attempt multiple login attempts using incorrect test passwords.
2. Monitor authentication logs.
3. Observe:

   * Failed login attempts
   * Repeated password trials
   * Account lockout responses

---

## **Program / Tools Used (Observation Only)**

### **Wireshark Filters**

```
tcp
http
https
```

### **Server Log Sample (Authentication)**

```
Login attempt failed for user: test_user
Login attempt failed for user: test_user
Account locked after multiple failures
```

## **Captured Data Verification**

### **MITM Simulation Results**

| Data Type           | Visibility |
| ------------------- | ---------- |
| IP Address          | Visible    |
| Protocol            | Visible    |
| Credentials (HTTP)  | Visible    |
| Credentials (HTTPS) | Encrypted  |

---

### **Dictionary Attack Results**

| Observation       | Result    |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| Failed logins     | Detected  |
| Password patterns | Logged    |
| Account lockout   | Triggered |

---

## **Output**

* Network packets captured showing encrypted communication
* Authentication logs showing multiple failed attempts
* No plaintext credentials exposed when SSL/TLS is used

---

## **Result**

Thus, a controlled test environment was successfully configured to **simulate MITM and dictionary attack scenarios**. Captured data was analyzed and verified, demonstrating the importance of **encryption, authentication controls, and intrusion detection mechanisms**.
