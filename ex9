. Investigate network monitoring tools and their functionalities. 

Aim

To investigate various network monitoring tools and study their functionalities in analyzing network performance and traffic behavior.

Objectives

To monitor network traffic in real time

To analyze packet flow and bandwidth

To identify open ports and services

To understand protocol behavior

To observe active network connections

Theory / Background

Network monitoring tools are essential for maintaining network performance and security. These tools provide real‑time insights into traffic flow, bandwidth usage, and potential network issues. Wireshark captures packets at the protocol level, Nmap identifies open ports and services, and Netstat displays active connections and network statistics.

Tools / Software Used

Wireshark

Nmap

Netstat

Procedure

Wireshark is launched and the network interface is selected.

Live packet capture is started.

Captured packets are analyzed based on protocols.

Nmap is used to scan the target network.

Netstat is used to display active connections.

Traffic statistics are analyzed.

Program / Commands Used
wireshark
nmap 192.168.1.1
netstat -an

Output

Network traffic was captured in real time.

Open ports and running services were identified.

Active connections were displayed.

Result

Network monitoring tools were successfully investigated and their functionalities were analyzed.
