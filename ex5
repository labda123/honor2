. Perform encryption and decryption using SSL and validate message integrity with test 
	   data. 
Aim

To perform encryption and decryption using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL/TLS) and to validate message integrity using test data, thereby understanding how secure communication is ensured in client–server systems and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) environments.

Objectives

To understand the concept of SSL/TLS

To establish a secure SSL connection

To perform encrypted data transmission

To validate message integrity

To study the importance of SSL in RPA workflows

Procedure
Step 1: Environment Setup

Ensure Python and OpenSSL are installed on the system.

Generate SSL certificates for secure communication.

Prepare test data for transmission.

Step 2: Generate SSL Certificate

Use OpenSSL to generate a self-signed certificate:

openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out server.crt -keyout server.key


This creates:

server.crt → SSL certificate

server.key → Private key

Step 3: Establish SSL Server

Create a server program that listens on a port.

Wrap the socket using SSL.

Accept encrypted client connections.

Step 4: Establish SSL Client

Create a client program.

Connect to the server using SSL.

Send encrypted test data.

Step 5: Validate Message Integrity

Server decrypts received data.

Server sends acknowledgment.

Client verifies received response.

Program
SSL Server Program (Python)
import socket, ssl

context = ssl.create_default_context(ssl.Purpose.CLIENT_AUTH)
context.load_cert_chain(certfile="server.crt", keyfile="server.key")

server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_socket.bind(('localhost', 8443))
server_socket.listen(1)

print("SSL Server waiting for connection...")

conn, addr = server_socket.accept()
ssl_conn = context.wrap_socket(conn, server_side=True)

data = ssl_conn.recv(1024)
print("Received (Decrypted):", data.decode())

ssl_conn.send(b"Message received securely")
ssl_conn.close()

SSL Client Program (Python)
import socket, ssl

context = ssl.create_default_context()
context.check_hostname = False
context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE

client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
ssl_client = context.wrap_socket(client_socket, server_hostname='localhost')

ssl_client.connect(('localhost', 8443))

message = "Secure RPA Communication Test"
ssl_client.send(message.encode())

data = ssl_client.recv(1024)
print("Server Response:", data.decode())

ssl_client.close()

Output
Server Output
SSL Server waiting for connection...
Received (Decrypted): Secure RPA Communication Test

Client Output
Server Response: Message received securely

Result

Thus, encryption and decryption using SSL were successfully performed. The transmitted test data was securely encrypted during transmission, decrypted at the receiver, and message integrity was validated without any data modification.

Ensure data received is unchanged.
