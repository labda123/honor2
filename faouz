Below is a **bigger, detailed, and RPA-relevant lab record answer**, written in **clear academic language**, suitable for **RPA / Automation Anywhere / UiPath–based syllabi** and ready to submit.

# **Experiment: Creating a Sequence to Obtain User Inputs and Display Them Using a Message Box (RPA)**

---

## **Aim**

To design and implement a **robotic process automation (RPA) sequence** that collects user inputs and displays the collected information using a **message box**, demonstrating the basic concept of **human–bot interaction** in RPA.

---

## **Procedure**

1. Launch the RPA development environment (such as **UiPath Studio** or **Automation Anywhere**).
2. Create a new **Sequence** workflow.
3. Use **Input Dialog** activity to obtain user details such as name and department.
4. Store the user inputs in string variables.
5. Use a **Message Box** activity to display the collected inputs.
6. Validate that the workflow executes sequentially without errors.
7. Stop the execution after successful display.

## **Program / Workflow Description (UiPath-Based RPA)**

### **Activities Used**

* **Sequence** – Controls the execution flow.
* **Input Dialog** – Captures user input.
* **Assign** – Stores input values in variables.
* **Message Box** – Displays output to the user.

---

### **Variables**

| Variable Name | Data Type | Description       |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| `userName`    | String    | Stores user name  |
| `userRole`    | String    | Stores user role  |
| `userDept`    | String    | Stores department |

---

### **Workflow Steps**

1. Add an **Input Dialog** to request the user’s name.
2. Add another **Input Dialog** to request the user’s role.
3. Add a third **Input Dialog** to request the department.
4. Concatenate the collected inputs.
5. Display the information using a **Message Box** activity.

---

### **Pseudo Code (RPA Logic)**

```
START
DISPLAY Input Dialog: "Enter Name"
STORE value in userName

DISPLAY Input Dialog: "Enter Role"
STORE value in userRole

DISPLAY Input Dialog: "Enter Department"
STORE value in userDept

DISPLAY Message Box:
"User Details:
Name: userName
Role: userRole
Department: userDept"
END
```

---

## **Output**

* The bot prompts the user for details using input dialogs.
* After entering the inputs, a message box displays the captured information.

**Sample Output (Message Box):**

```
User Details:
Name: Faouzia
Role: RPA Trainee
Department: Automation
```

---

## **Result**

Thus, a sequence-based RPA workflow was successfully created to obtain user inputs and display them using a message box. This experiment demonstrates **basic user interaction, sequential execution, and variable handling** in Robotic Process Automation.

---

## **Relevance to RPA**

* Demonstrates **human-in-the-loop automation**.
* Useful for collecting credentials, approval inputs, or form data.
* Forms the foundation for **automated business processes** such as onboarding, ticket creation, and data validation.
* Helps understand **workflow sequencing and activity orchestration** in RPA tools.
