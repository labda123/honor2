Use a security tool to carry out ARP poisoning and analyze the sniffed data. 
Aim

To perform ARP poisoning using a security tool and analyze the sniffed network data in order to understand Man‑in‑the‑Middle attacks and vulnerabilities present in local area networks.

Objectives

To study the working principle of the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

To understand ARP cache poisoning and its security implications

To perform a Man‑in‑the‑Middle (MITM) attack

To capture and analyze network packets using packet sniffing tools

To study the risks involved in unsecured and switched networks

Introduction / Theory

The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to map an IP address to a physical MAC address in a local network. Since ARP does not provide any authentication mechanism, it is vulnerable to attacks such as ARP spoofing or ARP poisoning. In an ARP poisoning attack, the attacker sends forged ARP messages to the network, associating the attacker’s MAC address with the IP address of another host (usually the gateway). As a result, the attacker becomes a Man‑in‑the‑Middle and can intercept, modify, or block network traffic.

Packet sniffing is the process of capturing network packets as they travel across the network. When combined with ARP poisoning, an attacker can analyze sensitive information such as IP addresses, session cookies, and protocol data.

Tools / Software Used

Kali Linux Operating System

Ettercap (for ARP Poisoning and MITM attack)

Wireshark (for packet sniffing and analysis)

Procedure

Kali Linux system is booted and connected to the same local network as the victim.

Network interface details are identified using the ifconfig command.

The IP and MAC addresses of devices in the network are identified using the arp -a command.

Ettercap is launched in graphical mode using the command ettercap -G.

Unified sniffing mode is selected by navigating to Sniff → Unified Sniffing.

The active network interface is selected to begin packet capture.

Host scanning is performed by selecting Hosts → Scan for Hosts.

The victim system is added as Target 1 and the default gateway is added as Target 2.

ARP poisoning is initiated by selecting Mitm → ARP Poisoning and enabling remote sniffing.

Network traffic between the victim and the gateway is intercepted.

Wireshark is opened simultaneously to capture and analyze network packets.

Captured packets such as HTTP, DNS, TCP, and UDP are analyzed.

Program / Commands Used
ifconfig
arp -a
ettercap -G
wireshark

Output

Network traffic between the victim and gateway was successfully intercepted.

Multiple packets were captured showing protocol details.

Sensitive network information such as IP addresses and session data were visible.

Result

The ARP poisoning attack was successfully performed, and network packets were captured and analyzed using packet sniffing tools.
