Write and execute a program to perform symmetric key encryption for a given message.  
Aim

To design, implement, and execute a program that performs symmetric key encryption and decryption for a given message using a single shared secret key, and to understand its importance in Robotic Process Automation (RPA) for securing sensitive business data.

Objective

To understand the concept of symmetric key encryption

To encrypt confidential data using a shared secret key

To decrypt encrypted data using the same key

Procedure

Start the program.

Define a secret key to be used for encryption and decryption.

Accept a plaintext message from the user.

Encrypt the message using the symmetric key.

Display the encrypted message.

Decrypt the encrypted message using the same key.

Display the decrypted message.

Stop the program.

Program (Python – AES Symmetric Encryption)
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

# Generate a symmetric key
key = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher = Fernet(key)

# Input message
message = input("Enter the message: ")

# Encrypt the message
encrypted_message = cipher.encrypt(message.encode())

# Decrypt the message
decrypted_message = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_message)

# Display results
print("\nSecret Key:", key)
print("Encrypted Message:", encrypted_message)
print("Decrypted Message:", decrypted_message.decode())

Output

Sample Execution:

Enter the message: RPA Automation Security

Secret Key: b'k8Zy5x2M3sP0J9H...'
Encrypted Message: b'gAAAAABlYJ...'
Decrypted Message: RPA Automation Security

Result

Thus, the program successfully performed symmetric key encryption and decryption using a single secret key. The original message was securely encrypted and later decrypted without data loss.
