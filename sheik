Below is a **detailed, lab-record–ready answer**, **fully relevant to RPA**, written in a **clear academic format** suitable for **UiPath / Automation Anywhere / Blue Prism** syllabi.

# **Experiment: Create a Flowchart to Navigate to a Desired Page Based on a Condition (RPA)**

---

## **Aim**

To design and implement a **flowchart-based robotic process automation (RPA) workflow** that navigates to different web pages based on a **user-defined condition**, demonstrating **decision-making and control flow** in RPA.

---

## **Procedure**

1. Open the RPA development tool (UiPath Studio / Automation Anywhere).
2. Create a new **Flowchart** workflow.
3. Define the **Start** node of the flowchart.
4. Use an **Input Dialog** activity to capture a condition from the user.
5. Add a **Flow Decision** activity to evaluate the condition.
6. Based on the condition, configure navigation to different web pages.
7. Use **Open Browser / Use Application-Browser** activities to navigate.
8. Display the navigation result using a **Message Box**.
9. End the workflow execution.

## **Program / Workflow Description (RPA Flowchart Logic)**

### **Activities Used**

* **Flowchart** – Controls non-linear workflow execution
* **Input Dialog** – Captures user input
* **Flow Decision** – Evaluates conditions (True / False)
* **Open Browser / Use Application-Browser** – Navigates to web pages
* **Message Box** – Displays navigation result

---

### **Variables**

| Variable Name | Data Type | Description           |
| ------------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| `userChoice`  | String    | Stores user input     |
| `targetURL`   | String    | Stores navigation URL |

---

### **Flowchart Logic (Text Representation)**

```
START
   |
   v
Input Dialog:
"Enter page type (Admin/User)"
   |
   v
Flow Decision:
Is userChoice = "Admin" ?
   | YES                       | NO
   v                           v
Open Admin Page URL        Open User Page URL
   |                           |
   v                           v
Message Box               Message Box
"Admin Page Opened"       "User Page Opened"
   |                           |
   v                           v
END                         END
```

---

## **Program (Pseudo Code – RPA Oriented)**

```
BEGIN
   userChoice = InputDialog("Enter page type: Admin or User")

   IF userChoice == "Admin" THEN
       Open Browser "https://admin.portal.com"
       MessageBox("Admin page opened successfully")
   ELSE
       Open Browser "https://user.portal.com"
       MessageBox("User page opened successfully")
   END IF
END
```

---

## **Output**

* The bot prompts the user to enter a choice.
* Based on the entered condition, the bot navigates to the corresponding web page.
* A confirmation message is displayed.

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter page type: Admin
Admin page opened successfully
```

---

## **Result**

Thus, a flowchart-based RPA workflow was successfully created to navigate to a desired page based on a condition. This experiment demonstrates **conditional branching, decision-making, and dynamic navigation** using RPA flowcharts.

---

## **Relevance to RPA**

* Implements **decision-based automation**
* Used in **role-based access workflows**
* Helpful in **login routing, approvals, and exception handling**
* Demonstrates real-world **business rule execution**
* Improves understanding of **Flowcharts vs Sequences** in RPA

---

## **Viva-Voce (Optional)**

**Q1. Why use Flowchart instead of Sequence in RPA?**
Flowcharts are used when workflows require multiple decision paths and non-linear execution.

**Q2. Where is this used in real-time automation?**
In dashboards, ERP systems, banking portals, and approval systems.
