EXPERIMENT – 8
Demonstration of Intrusion Detection System Using Snort
Aim

To demonstrate the working of an Intrusion Detection System using a security tool to detect unauthorized access and suspicious network activities.

Objectives

To understand the need for intrusion detection

To study signature‑based intrusion detection

To detect malicious network activities

To generate alerts for security violations

To analyze intrusion logs

Theory / Background

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security solution designed to monitor network traffic or system activities for malicious behavior or policy violations. IDS can be classified as Network‑based IDS (NIDS) or Host‑based IDS (HIDS). Snort is a popular open‑source NIDS that performs real‑time traffic analysis and packet logging using predefined rules.

Snort examines each packet and compares it against a set of rules. When a rule matches, an alert is generated. IDS helps administrators detect attacks such as port scanning, denial of service attempts, and unauthorized access.

Tools / Software Used

Kali Linux

Snort IDS Tool

Procedure

Snort is installed using the package manager.

The Snort configuration file is edited.

HOME_NET variable is configured to protect the local network.

Snort is started in IDS mode.

Network traffic is monitored continuously.

Suspicious traffic is generated using tools like Nmap.

Snort analyzes traffic based on defined rules.

Alerts are generated for detected intrusions.

Program / Commands Used
sudo apt install snort
sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf
sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0
nmap -sS <target-IP>

Output

Alerts were displayed for port scanning activities.

Intrusion attempts were detected.

Log entries were generated.

Result

The Intrusion Detection System successfully detected and alerted on suspicious network activities.
